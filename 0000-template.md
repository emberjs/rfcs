# Summary

One para explanation of the feature.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Detailed design

### Glossary
This is where you can find definitions of terms used in the underlying detailed design.

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar
with the framework to understand, and for somebody familiar with the implementation to implement.
This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used.
Any new terminology should be defined here.

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved questions

What parts of the design are still TBD?
