- PR to Accepted Stage: #__RFC_NUMBER__ 

**An FCP is required before merging this PR to advance.**

Upon merging this PR, automation will open a draft PR for this RFC to move to the [Released Stage](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs#released).

<details>
  <summary>Ready for Release Stage Description</summary>

This stage is complete when the implementation is complete according to plan outlined in the RFC, and is in harmony with any changes in Ember that have occurred since the RFC was first written. This includes any necessary learning materials. At this stage, features or deprecations may be available for use behind a feature flag, or with an optional package, etc.

For codebase changes, there are no open questions that are anticipated to require breaking changes; the Ember team is ready to commit to the stability of any interfaces exposed by the current implementation of the feature.

This stage should include a list of criteria for determining when the proposal can be considered Recommended after being Released.

An FCP is required to move into this stage.

Each Ember core team will be requested as a reviewer on the PR to move into this stage. A representative of each team adds a review. If a team does not respond to the request, and after the conclusion of the FCP, it is assumed that the release may proceed.
