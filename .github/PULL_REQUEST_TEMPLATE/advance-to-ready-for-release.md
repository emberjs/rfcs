# Advance #__RFC_NUMBER__ to the [Ready For Release Stage](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs#ready-for-release)

## Summary

This pull request is advancing the RFC to the [Ready For Release Stage](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs#ready-for-release).

- PR to Accepted Stage: #__RFC_NUMBER__ 

**An FCP is required before merging this PR to advance.**


<details>
  <summary>Ready for Release Stage Description</summary>
This stage is complete when the implementation is complete according to plan 
outlined in the RFC, and is in harmony with any changes in Ember that have 
occurred since the RFC was first written. This includes any necessary learning 
materials. At this stage, features or deprecations may be available for use 
behind a feature flag, or with an optional package, etc.

For codebase changes, there are no open questions that are anticipated to 
require breaking changes; the Ember team is ready to commit to the stability of 
any interfaces exposed by the current implementation of the feature.

This stage should include a list of criteria for determining when the proposal can be considered Recommended after being Released.

An FCP is required to move into this stage.

Each Ember core team will be requested as a reviewer on the PR to move into this stage. A representative of each team adds a review. If a team does not respond to the request, and after the conclusion of the FCP, it is assumed that the release may proceed.
