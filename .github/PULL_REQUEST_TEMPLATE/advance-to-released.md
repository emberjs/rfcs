<summary>Released Stage Summary</summary>

The work is published. If it is codebase-related work, it is in a stable version of the relevant package(s). If there are any critical deviations from the original RFC, they are briefly noted at the top of the RFC.

If the work for an RFC is spread across multiple releases of Ember or other packages, the RFC is considered to be in the Released stage when all features are available in stable releases and those packages and versions are noted in the RFC frontmatter.

Ember's RFC process can be used for process and work plans that are not about code. Some examples include Roadmap RFCs, changes to the RFC process itself, and changes to learning resources. When such an RFC is a candidate for Released, the work should be shipped as described, and the result should presented to the team with the intent of gathering feedback about whether anything is missing. If there is agreement that the work is complete, the RFC may be marked "Released" and a date is provided instead of a version.

An RFC is moved into "Released" when the above is verified by consensus of the relevant team(s) via a PR to update the stage.
