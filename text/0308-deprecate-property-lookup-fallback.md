# Summary

Beginning the transition to deprecate the fallback behavior of resolving `{{foo}}` by requiring the usage of `{{this.foo}}` as syntax to refer to properties of the templates' backing component. This would be the default behavior in Glimmer Components.

For example, given the following component class:

```js
import Component from '@ember/component';
export default Component.extends({
  init() {
    super(...arguments);
    this.set('greeting', 'Hello');
  }
});
```

One would refer to the `greeting` property as such:

```hbs
<h1>{{this.greeting}}, Chad</h1>
```

Ember will render "Hello, Chad".

To make this deprecation tractable, we will provide a codemod for migrating templates.

# Motivation

Currently, the way to access properties on a components class is `{{greeting}}` from a template. This works because the component class is one of the objects we resolve against during the evaluation of the expression.

The first problem with this approach is that the `{{greeting}}` syntax is ambiguous, as it could be referring to a local variable (block param), a helper with no arguments, a closed over component, or a property on the component class.

## Exemplar

Consider the following example where the ambiguity can cause issues:

You have a component class that looks like the following component and template:

```js
import Component from '@ember/component';
import computed from '@ember/computed';

export default Component.extend({
  formatName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', function() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  });
});
```

```hbs
<h1>Hello {{formatName}}!</h1>
```

Given `{ firstName: 'Chad', lastName: 'Hietala' }`, Ember will render the following:

```html
<h1>Hello Chad Hietala!</h1>
```

Now some time goes on and someone adds a `formatName` helper at `app/helpers/fortmatName.js` that looks like the following:

```js
export default function formatName([firstName, lastName]) {
  return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
}
```

Due to the fact that helpers take precedence over property lookups, our `{{formatName}}` now resolves to a helper. When the helper runs it doesn't have any arguments so our template now renders the following:

```html
<h1>Hello !</h1>
```

This can be a refactoring hazard and can often lead to confusion for readers of the template. Upon encountering `{{greeting}}` in a component's template, the reader has to check all of these places: first, you need to scan the surrounding lines for block params with that name; next, you check in the helpers folder to see if there is a helper with that name (it could also be coming from an addon!); finally, you check the component's JavaScript class to look for a (computed) property.

Like [RFC#0276](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/68812bf2d439c6bb77ad491e0159b371b68c5c35/text/0276-named-args.md) made argument usage explicit through the `@` prefix, the `this` prefix will resolve the ambiguity and greatly improve clarity, especially in big projects with a lot of files (and uses a lot of addons).

As an aside, the ambiguity that causes confusion for human readers is also a problem for the compiler. While it is not the main goal of this proposal, resolving this ambiguity also helps the rendering system. Currently, the "runtime" template compiler has to perform a helper lookup for every `{{greeting}}` in each template. It will be able to skip this resolution process and perform other optimizations (such as reusing the internal [reference](https://github.com/glimmerjs/glimmer-vm/blob/master/guides/04-references.md)
object and caches) with this addition.

Furthermore, by enforcing the `this` prefix, tooling like the [Ember Language Server](https://github.com/emberwatch/ember-language-server) does not need to know about fallback resolution rules. This makes common features like ["Go To Definition"](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_go-to-definition) much easier to implement since we have semantics that mean "property on class".

# Transition Path

We intend this to be a _very slow_ process as we understand it is a large change. Because of this we will be doing a phased rollout to help guide people in transtion. Below is an outline of how we plan to roll this change out.

**Phase 1:**
- Add [template lint rule](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint/pull/392) to [ember-template-lint](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint) as an **opt-in** rule
- Document the [codemod infrastructure](https://github.com/dyfactor/dyfactor) and [codemod](https://github.com/dyfactor/dyfactor-plugin-disambiguate-locals). Make it available for early adopters
- Start updating docs to use `this.`

**Phase 2:**
- Add the lint rule by default _in the apps_ `.template-lintrc.js`
- Complete doc migration to use `this.`

**Phase 3:**
- Enable the lint rule by default in the `recommended` config

**Phase 4:**
- Introduce deprecation **app only** fallbacks

**Phase 5:**
- Introduce deprecation for **any** fallbacks

**Phase 6:**
- Rev major to 4.0.0
- Add assert for fallback behavior

**Phase 7:**
- Remove fallback functionality in 4.5, post 4.4.0 LTS

# How We Teach This

`{{this.foo}}` is the way to access the properties on the component class. This also aligns with property access in JavaScript.

Since the `{{this.foo}}` syntax has worked in Ember.Component (which is the only kind of component available today) since the 1.0 series, we are not really in a rush to migrate the community (and the guides, etc) to using the new syntax. In the meantime, this could be viewed as a tool to improve clarity in templates.

While we think writing `{{this.foo}}` would be a best practice for new code going forward, the community can migrate at its own pace one component at a time. However, once the fallback functionality is eventually removed this will result in a "Helper not found" error.

## Syntax Breakdown

The follow is a breakdown of the different forms and what they mean:

- `{{@foo}}` is an argument passed to the component
- `{{this.foo}}` is a property on the component class
- `{{#with this.foo as |foo|}} {{foo}} {{/with}}` the `{{foo}}` is a local
- `{{foo}}` is a helper

# Drawbacks

The largest downside of this proposal is that it makes templates more verbose, causing developers to type a bit more. This will also create a decent amount of deprecation noise, although we feel like tools like [ember-cli-deprecation-workflow](https://github.com/mixonic/ember-cli-deprecation-workflow) can help mitigate this.

# Alternatives

This pattern of having programming model constructs to distinguish between the backing class and arguments passed to the component is not unique to Ember.

## What Other Frameworks Do

React has used `this.props` to talk about values passed to you and `this.state` to mean data owned by the backing component class since it was released. However, this approach of creating a specific object on the component class to mean "properties available to the template", would likely be even more an invasive change and goes against the mental model that the context for the template is the class.

Vue requires enumeration of `props` passed to a component, but the values in the template suffer from the ambiguity that we are trying to solve.

Angular relies heavily on the dependency injection e.g. `@Input` to enumerate the bindings that were passed to the component and relies heavily on TypeScript to hide or expose values to templating layer with `public` and `private` fields. Like Vue, Angular does not disambiguate.

## Introduce Yet Another Sigil

We could introduce another sigil to remove ambiguity. This would address the concern about verbosity, however it is now another thing we would have to teach.

## Change Resolution Order

The other option is to reverse the resolution order to prefer properties over helpers. However this has the reverse problem as described in the exemplar.

## Do Nothing

I personally don't think this is an option, since the goal is to provide clarity for applications as they evolve over time and to provide a more concise mental model.
