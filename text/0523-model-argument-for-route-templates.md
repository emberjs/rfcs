# Provide `@model` named argument to route templates

## Summary

Allow route templates to access the route's model with `@model` in addition to
`this.model`.

Before:

```hbs
{{!-- The model for this route is the current user --}}

<div>
  Hi <img src="{{this.model.profileImage}}" alt="{{this.model.name}}'s profile picture"> {{this.model.name}},
  this is a valid Ember template!
</div>

{{#if this.model.isAdmin}}
  <div>Remember, with great power comes great responsibility!</div>
{{/if}}
```

After:

```hbs
{{!-- The model for this route is the current user --}}

<div>
  Hi <img src="{{@model.profileImage}}" alt="{{@model.name}}'s profile picture"> {{@model.name}},
  this is a valid Ember template!
</div>

{{#if @model.isAdmin}}
  <div>Remember, with great power comes great responsibility!</div>
{{/if}}
```

## Motivation

With the Octane release, templates are taking on a more important role in
idomatic Ember apps. As templates become more self-sufficient, many cases where
a JavaScript class was needed in the past (e.g. to customize the "wrapper"
element) can now be expressed with templates alone. This is a direction we will
continue post-Octane.

We would like to update the learning materials (guides) to focus on teaching
the template-centric component model. For example, components can be introduced
as a way to break up large templates into smaller, named pieces, similar to
refactoring a big function into smaller ones. Then, we can layer on making them
reusable through passing arguments. Next, we can introduce the idea of passing
a block and yielding. Finally, we can introduce the component class when we are
ready to discuss adding behavior to the component.

As you can see, we can accomplish quite a lot with template-only components in
Octane, and focusing on teaching templates first-and-foremost would provide
a gentle learning curve for developers and designers who are comfortable with
HTML but perhaps new to Ember (or even JavaScript). With this flow, the concept
of a component class, and consequently, the idea of a "`this` context" in a
template comes up quite late.

This presents a problem, as we may want or need to teach route templates before
that was introduced. As the model can only be accessed through `this.model` in
a route template, we would be forced to introduce that concept (and the contept
of a controller) at an earlier time than would be ideal.

Providing `@model` to route templates would solve this problem quite elegantly.
We will now be able to introduce the concept of arguments (`@name`) once and it
can be applied consistently between component and route templates.

This also aligns with the general mental model that arguments are things that
are passed into the template from the outside (which is true in the case of the
route model).

This can also be thought of as a small incremental step in the bigger picture
of reforming route templates and removing controllers from Ember. Specifically,
it moves us a bit closer to the mental model that controllers/route templates
are just a "special" kind of component. We expect to continually unify them and
remove the remaining differences, and this is a step towards that direction.

## Detailed design

Internally, route templates are _already_ modelled as components at the Glimmer
VM layer. To implement this, we would "synthesize" a named argument `@model`
containing the resolved route model, i.e. the same value as `this.model` on the
controller instance.

Just like the "reflected" named arguments in classic components, mutating
`this.model` on the controller instance would _not_ change the value of
`@model`. In practice, this seems unlikely to be relied upon and probably
considered a bad practice (it does not change the URL, does not affect what is
returned by `route.modelFor`, etc). In any case, this is consistent with the
general behavior for named arguments, in that they are immutable and should
always reflect what was "passed in" from the caller.

## How we teach this

In the guides, we should teach that `@names` are for things that are "passed
in", i.e. arguments to the template.

In the tutorial, basic components concepts (template-only components, invoking
a component with args, using the args with the template, etc) should be taught
before the `model` hook is encountered. At that point, explaining that `@model`
is passed into the component from the route, based on the resolution of the
async `model` hook, will be quite natural.

For reference, here is a relevant section from the [work-in-progress Octane
tutorial](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/1002). For context,
up until this point, we have taught all the basic component concepts above, plus
adding a (Glimmer) component class, adding instance variables and getters to the
component, accessing those with `{{this.*}}` in the template, etc.

As you can see, there are some awkwardness explaining `this.model` at this
point. Knowing that there is a `this` context on the template, it is only
natural to inquire what _is_ the `this` we are referring to here.

Up until this point in the tutorial, the only place where we have access to a
`this` object in the template is a component with a class. Since the route
class is the only related class we made at this point, and it happens to have
a `model` property (a method) on it, one natural conclusion is to think that
`this` refers to the route instance, and `this.model` refers to the model hook.

But that completely the wrong mental model! To avoid that, we put in a "Zoey
says..." sidebar that explicitly denies that incorrect mental model, stating
what it _is not_, without really explaining what it _is_.

To fully explain what is going on, we would have to pause and take a detour to
explain everyone's least favourite part of the Ember programming model –
controllers. This would be extremely disruptive to the teaching flow, to say
the least, but also serves no purpose at all.

We opted to avoid going down that rabit hole and just treated it as a
boilerplate syntax you have to type.

If we are able to explain this using `@model` instead, it would make things a
lot smoother here.

We wouldn't have to go into the details of _how_ things get invoked internally.
At the end of the day, it is still just a piece of syntax you type to get the
job done, but at least it is consistent with the general mental model that
`@names` means that thing was passed in, and it does not trigger the questions
about what `this` is.

It is also _not_ inconsistent with the fact that there is, in fact, a `this`
context on the template. The usage and preference of using `@names` does not
preclude the existance of a class (which provides the `this` context), as in
the case of `@ember/components`.

As for the concrete changes that need to be made in the documentation:

* We will explain that `@model` is passed into the component from the route.
  For example, in the `Route` class' `model` hook documentation, we can say
  something like:

  > The model hook is responsible for fetching and preparing any data that you
  > need for your route. Ember will automatically call this hook for when
  > entering a route, so that you can have an opportunity to do what you need to
  > get the data you need. The object returned from this hook is known as the
  > _model_ for the route.
  >
  > Note that since this is an `async` hook, if a promise is returned, it will
  > be automatically `await`ed by Ember, and the _resolved value_ of the
  > promise, as opposed to the promise object itself, will become the model of
  > the route.
  >
  > The model object can be accessed from the route's template as using the
  > `@model` argument. By default, the controller can also accessed the route's
  > model from `this.model`. The latter behavior is customizable, see the
  > _setupController_ method for details.
  >
  > The model of a route should be treated as read-only. For example, the
  > controller _should not_ mutate its `this.model` property, as doing so will
  > cause it to get out of sync with the rest of the system. Specifically,
  > doing so will _not_ update the current URL, the `@model` argument in the
  > template, the router service, etc. Instead, a _route transition_ should be
  > performed.

* Guides and API docs should be updated to prefer `@model` in route templates.
* API docs will still document the `model` property.
* We will remove any examples that uses `{{this.model}}` in templates, or replace them with `{{@model}}`. i.e. we won’t be documenting using `this.model` in templates, even thought it would “work”.

## Drawbacks

In some applications, developers have developed a pattern to override the
`setupController` method to assign the model to a different property on the
controller other than the default `model` naming convention.

Since this RFC does not provide any way to customize the name of the argument,
developers using this pattern will have to choose between one of the following
two options:

1. Refactor/revert to the default behavior of `setupController` and use the
   default `model` property. This makes it cognitively easy to understand the
   `@model` usages in the route templates.

2. Stick with the alternative names and avoid using `@model` in the route
   templates, until there is a way to customize both names at the same time.

Technically, it is also possible to use one name in the controller and
`@model` in the template. This doesn't cause any issues for the system, but
maybe confusing for the developers.

In the future, we expect to generalize the `model` hook and `@model` into
allowing passing arbitrary arguments into the template, perhaps replacing
the `model` hook with something like an `args` hook that returns a POJO of
arguments to pass.

## Alternatives

We can do nothing.

## Unresolved questions

None?
