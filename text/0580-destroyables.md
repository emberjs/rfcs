# Destroyables

## Summary

Adds an API for registering destroyables and destructors with Ember's built in
destruction hierarchy.

```js
class MyComponent extends Component {
  constructor() {
    let timeoutId = setTimeout(() => console.log('hello'), 1000);

    registerDestructor(this, () => clearTimeout(timeoutId));
  }
}
```

The API will also enable users to create and manage their own destroyables, and
associate them with a parent destroyable.

```js
class TimeoutManager {
  constructor(parent, fn, timeout = 1000) {
    let timeoutId = setTimeout(fn, timeout);

    associateDestroyableChild(parent, this);
    registerDestructor(this, () => clearTimeout(timeoutId));
  }
}

class MyComponent extends Component {
  manager = new TimeoutManager(this, () => console.log('hello'));
}
```

## Motivation

Ember manages the lifecycles and lifetimes of many built in constructs, such as
components, and does so in a hierarchical way - when a parent component is
destroyed, all of its children are destroyed as well. This is a well established
software pattern that is useful for many applications, and there are a variety
of libraries, such as [ember-lifeline](https://github.com/ember-lifeline/ember-lifeline)
and [ember-concurrency](https://github.com/machty/ember-concurrency), that would
benefit from having a way to extend this hierarchy, adding their own "children"
that are cleaned up whenever their parents are removed.

Historically, Ember has exposed this cleanup lifecycle via _hooks_, such as the
`willDestroy` hook on components. However, methods like these have a number of
downsides:

1. Since they are named, they can have collisions with other properties. This is
   historically what led to the actions hash on classic components, in order to
   avoid collisions between actions named `destroy` and the `destroy` lifecyle
   hook.
2. On a related note, relying on property names means that all framework classes
   _must_ implement the `willDestroy` function (or another name), making it very
   difficult to change APIs in the future.
3. Methods are difficult for _libraries_ to instrument. For instance,
   `ember-concurrency` currently replaces the `willDestroy` method on any class
   with a task, with logic that looks similar to:

   ```js
   let PATCHED = new WeakSet();

   function patchWillDestroy(obj) {
     if (PATCHED.has(obj)) return;

     let oldWillDestroy = obj.willDestroy;

     obj.willDestroy = function () {
       if (oldWillDestroy) oldWillDestroy.call(this);

       teardownTasks(this);
     };

     PATCHED.add(obj);
   }
   ```

   This logic becomes especially convoluted if _multiple_ libraries are
   attempting to patch `willDestroy` in this way.

4. Finally, since this isn't a standard, it's difficult to add _layers_ of new
   destroyable values that can interoperate with one another. For instance,
   there is no way for `ember-concurrency` to know how to destroy tasks on
   non-framework classes that users may have added themselves.

This RFC proposes a streamlined API that disconnects the exact implementation
from any interface, allows for multiple destructors per-destroyable, and
maximizes interoperability in general.

## Detailed design

The API consists of 6 main functions, imported from `@ember/destroyable`:

```ts
declare function associateDestroyableChild<T extends object>(parent: object, child: T): T;

declare function registerDestructor<T extends object>(
  destroyable: T,
  destructor: (destroyable: T) => void
): (destroyable: T) => void;

declare function unregisterDestructor<T extends object>(
  destroyable: T,
  destructor: (destroyable: T) => void
): void;

declare function destroy(destroyable: object): void;
declare function isDestroying(destroyable: object): boolean;
declare function isDestroyed(destroyable: object): boolean;
```

In addition, there is a debug-only mode function used for testing:

```ts
declare function assertDestroyablesDestroyed(): void;
```

For the remainder of this RFC, the terms "destroyable" and "destroyable object"
will be used to mean any object which is a valid `WeakMap` key
(e.g. `typeof obj === 'object' || typeof obj === 'function'`). Any JS object
that fulfills this property can be used with this system.

#### `associateDestroyableChild`

This function is used to associate a destroyable object with a parent. When the
parent is destroyed, all registered children will also be destroyed.

```js
class CustomSelect extends Component {
  constructor() {
    // obj is now a child of the component. When the component is destroyed,
    // obj will also be destroyed, and have all of its destructors triggered.
    this.obj = associateDestroyableChild(this, {});
  }
}
```

Returns the associated child for convenience.

- Attempting to associate a parent or child that has already been destroyed
  or is being destroyed should throw an error.

##### Multiple Inheritance

Attempting to associate a child to multiple parents should currently throw an
error. This could be changed in the future, but for the time being multiple
inheritance of destructors is tricky and not scoped in. Instead, users can add
destructors to accomplish this goal:

```js
let parent1 = {},
  parent2 = {},
  child = {};

registerDestructor(parent1, () => destroy(child));
registerDestructor(parent2, () => destroy(child));
```

The exact timing semantics here will be a bit different, but for most use cases
this should be fine. If we find that it would be useful to have multiple
inheritance baked in in the future, it can be added in a followup RFC.

#### `registerDestructor`

Receives a destroyable object and a destructor function, and associates the
function with it. When the destroyable is destroyed with `destroy`, or when its
parent is destroyed, the destructor function will be called.

```js
import { registerDestructor } from '@ember/destroyable';

class Modal extends Component {
  @service resize;

  constructor() {
    this.resize.register(this, this.layout);

    registerDestructor(this, () => this.resize.unregister(this));
  }
}
```

Multiple destructors can be associated with a given destroyable, and they can be
associated over time, allowing libraries like `ember-lifeline` to dynamically
add destructors as needed. `registerDestructor` also returns the associated
destructor function, for convenience.

The destructor function is passed a single argument, which is the destroyable
itself. This allows the function to be reused multiple times for many
destroyables, rather than creating a closure function per destroyable.

```js
import { registerDestructor } from '@ember/destroyable';

function unregisterResize(instance) {
  instance.resize.unregister(instance);
}

class Modal extends Component {
  @service resize;

  constructor() {
    this.resize.register(this, this.layout);

    registerDestructor(this, unregisterResize);
  }
}
```

- Registering a destructor on a destroyed object or object that is being destroyed should throw an error.
- Attempting to register the same destructor multiple times should throw an
  error.

#### `unregisterDestructor`

Receives a destroyable and a destructor function, and de-associates the
destructor from the destroyable.

```js
import { unregisterDestructor } from '@ember/destroyable';

class Modal extends Component {
  @service modals;

  constructor() {
    this.modals.add(this);

    this.modalDestructor = registerDestructor(this, () => this.modals.remove(this));
  }

  @action pinModal() {
    unregisterDestructor(this, this.modalDestructor);
  }
}
```

- Calling `unregisterDestructor` on a destroyed object should throw an error.
- Calling `unregisterDestructor` with a destructor that is not associated with
  the object should throw an error.

#### `destroy`

`destroy` initiates the destruction of a destroyable object. It runs all
associated destructors, and then destroys all children recursively.

```js
let obj = {};

registerDestructor(obj, () => console.log('destroyed!'));

destroy(obj); // this will schedule the destructor to be called

// ...some time later, during scheduled destruction

// destroyed!
```

Destruction via `destroy()` follows these steps:

1. Mark the destroyable such that `isDestroying(destroyable)` returns `true`
2. Schedule calling the destroyable's destructors
3. Call `destroy()` on each of the destroyable's associated children
4. Schedule setting destroyable such that `isDestroyed(destroyable)` returns `true`

This algorithm results in the entire tree of destroyables being first marked as
destroying, then having all of their destructors called, and finally all being
marked as `isDestroyed`. There won't be any in between states where some items
are marked as `isDestroying` while destroying, while others are not.

Calling `destroy` multiple times on the same destroyable is safe. It will not
throw an error, and will not take any further action.

Calling `destroy` with a destroyable that has no destructors or associated children
will not throw an error, and will do nothing.

#### `isDestroying`

Receives a destroyable, and returns `true` if the destroyable has begun
destroying. Otherwise returns false.

```js
let obj = {};
isDestroying(obj); // false
destroy(obj);
isDestroying(obj); // true
// ...sometime later, after scheduled destruction
isDestroyed(obj); // true
isDestroying(obj); // true
```

#### `isDestroyed`

Receives a destroyable, and returns `true` if the destroyable has finished
destroying. Otherwise returns false.

```js
let obj = {};

isDestroyed(obj); // false
destroy(obj);

// ...sometime later, after scheduled destruction

isDestroyed(obj); // true
```

#### `assertDestroyablesDestroyed`

This function asserts that all objects which have associated destructors or
associated children have been destroyed at the time it is called. It is meant to
be a low level hook that testing frameworks like `ember-qunit` and `ember-mocha`
can use to hook into and validate that all destroyables have in fact been
destroyed.

### Built In Destroyables

The root destroyable of an Ember application will be the instance of the owner.
All framework managed classes are destroyables, including:

- Components
- Services
- Routes
- Controllers
- Helpers
- Modifiers

Any future classes that are added and have a container managed lifecycle should
also be marked as destroyables.

## How we teach this

Destroyables are not a very commonly used primitive, but they are fairly core to
Ember applications. Most destruction lifecycle hooks will be rationalized as
destroyables under the hood, and and it is key to how the application manages
lifecycles. As such, destroyables should be covered in an _In-Depth Guide_ in
the Core Concepts section of the guides.

### Guide Outline

The guide should start by discussing lifecycle, in particular focusing on in the
existing lifecycle hooks that users will already know about, such as
`willDestroy` on components. It should cover how at a high level, every
framework concept exists in a _lifecycle tree_, where children are tied to the
lifecyles of their parents. When something in the tree is destroyed, like a
component so are all of its children.

The destroyable APIs can then be brought in to discuss how one might add to the
tree, if they have concepts whose lifecycles would logically belong to it. This
should be done primarily through examples. Some ideas for possible examples
include:

1. A simple remote data fetcher. The request needs to be cancelled if the parent
   is destroyed, which is a perfect use case for a destroyable.
2. A task manager that manages a variety of long lived tasks.
3. Possibly another example where a completely independent tree is made, for
   some sort of library that would be otherwise external to Ember.

The rest of the guide could show in detail how the user would use the APIs to
accomplish this goal, and how it would be better and more scalable than doing it
with lifecycle hooks.

There should also be a section on _when_ to use the low-level destroyable APIs,
vs the standard lifecycle hooks.

### API Docs

The descriptions of the APIs above in the RFC are sufficient detail for the bulk
of API documentation, with some light editing.

## Drawbacks

- Adds another destruction API which may conflict with the existing destruction
  hooks. Since this is a low-level API, it shouldn't be too problematic - most
  users will be guided toward using the standard lifecycle hooks, and this API
  will exist for libraries like `ember-concurrency` and `ember-lifeline`.

## Alternatives

- Continue using existing lifecycle hooks for public API, and don't provide an
  independent API.
