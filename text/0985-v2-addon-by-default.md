# Change the default addon blueprint

## Summary

`@embroider/addon-blueprint` has been in progress for a while, it's good stuff. 


## Motivation

We want to encourage folks use v2 addons instead of the classic addon blueprint.

V1 addons are built by apps on every boot, every build.
V2 addons are built at publish time, so the app can build faster.

## Detailed design

`@embroider/addon-blueprint` will remain its own repo. `ember addon` will use this by default without a flag at some point.

## How we teach this

> What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this
idea best presented? As a continuation of existing Ember patterns, or as a
wholly new one?

> Would the acceptance of this proposal mean the Ember guides must be
re-organized or altered? Does it change how Ember is taught to new users
at any level?

> How should this feature be introduced and taught to existing Ember
users?

## Drawbacks

> Why should we *not* do this? Please consider the impact on teaching Ember,
on the integration of this feature with other existing and planned features,
on the impact of the API churn on existing apps, etc.

> There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives

> What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

> This section could also include prior art, that is, how other frameworks in the same domain have solved this problem.

## Unresolved questions

> Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
