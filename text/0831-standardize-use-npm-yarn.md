# Standardize use of scripts in package.json for common tasks

Standardize the use of yarn and npm scripts in the Ember experience

## Summary

This change encourages developers to use scripts in `package.json` 
for certain commands when working with Ember
applications, rather than using global Ember CLI commands like `ember serve` or focusing on npm/yarn.
This aligns Ember with norms in the JavaScript community, and
helps in reducing the confusion around Ember-specific commands.

## Motivation

In many JavaScript projects, the following commands are very common:

```
npm start
npm test
```

These scripts are defined in the `package.json` of Ember apps, however,
Ember's documentation tells developers to run these commands instead:

```
ember serve
ember test
```

Notably, `ember test` and `npm test` give different results.

When we run `ember test`, it sets the environment to test and performs `Ember.onerror` validation by default.
Whereas, in the case of `npm test`, there is an abstraction of the underlying commands that allows the user to run extra checks such as lint tests across the files and finally performs `ember test`.
This is useful in carrying on a sequence of instructions and using them without having to worry about how they function behind the hood.
As a result, a lot of developer time is saved and it also reduces the human error that might have been made if the abstract tooling was not used.

`npm test` 
![Npm test](/images/npm_test.png)

If documentation encouraged using `yarn` or `npm`, this would allow developers to customize the scripts
themselves while also having a standard command that everyone can run in any project 
and get an expected output, regardless of what's going on under the hood. We can include a link to "prior art" of showing `npm start` in CLI output.

Consider cases where the author of an addon sets up `yarn test` to run with `ember-exam`.
In such cases, one shouldn't be manually changing the default documentation for a script that already existed.

In another case of using the `package.json` script for start/test, it allows teams to abstract details about their specific dev environment,
which makes developers' jobs easier. They can use `yarn start` or 
`pnpm start` without actually having to know which command starts the server.
Moreover, using tooling abstraction provided by npm/yarn helps in staying consistent with industry standards rather than having to use bespoke
tools.

## Detailed design

This will involve two steps

1. We should decide whether we want a Standardize the use of yarn/npm scripts.

2. Then we make the changes in READMEs, contributing guides, CLI output, and in learning docs.

## How we teach this

The following resources would need to change:

* Ember-cli guides
* Ember guides 
* Ember API documentation 
* The Super Rentals tutorial
* Readme.md and Contributing.md of repos
* Blueprints in `ember-cli`
* We should mention that developers should always refer to Contributing.md for full instructions when working with a new app or addon. And following commands as examples: start, test, build, and prepare.

## Drawbacks

> Why should we *not* do this? Please consider the impact on teaching Ember,
on the integration of this feature with other existing and planned features,
on the impact of the API churn on existing apps, etc.

> There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives

* No change

## Unresolved questions

*  How does the difference between yarn 1, 2, and 3 affect us if we made this change?
*  Should we show yarn and npm for every example?
