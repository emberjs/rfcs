# Deprecation of Ember.Logger

## Summary

This RFC recommends the deprecation and eventual removal of `Ember.Logger`.

## Motivation

There are a variety of features of Ember designed to support old browsers,
features that are no longer needed. `Ember.Logger` came into being because
the browser support for the console was inconsistent. In some browsers,
like Internet Explorer 9, the console only existed when the developer tools
panel was open, which caused null references and program crashes when run
with the console closed. `Ember.Logger` provided methods that would route to
the console when it was available.

With Ember 3.x, Ember no longer supports these older browsers, and hence this
feature no longer serves a purpose. Removing it will make Ember smaller and
lighter.

## Detailed design

For the most part, this is a 1:1 substitution of the global `console` object
for `Ember.Logger`.

Node only added support for `console.debug` in Node version 9. Where we wish
to support earlier versions of Node, we will need to use `console.log`, rather than
`console.debug`, as the replacement for `Logger.debug`. Apps and addons
which don't care about Node or are specifying Node version 9 as their minimum can
use `console.debug`.

Internet Explorer 11 and Edge both require console methods to be bound to the
console object when the developer tools are not showing. This diverges from the
expectations of other browsers. Direct calls to console methods will work correctly,
but constructs which involve explicitly or implicitly binding the console methods to
other objects or using them unbound will fail. This is straightforward to work around.

You can address the issue by binding the method to the console object:

``` javascript
// Before - assigning raw method to a variable for later use
var print = Logger.log; // assigning method to variable
print('Message');

// After - assigning console-bound method to variable for later use
var print = console.log.bind(console);
print('Message');
```

In some cases, you can use rest parameter syntax to avoid the issue entirely:

``` javascript
// Before
Logger.info.apply(undefined, arguments); // or
Logger.info.apply(null, arguments); // or
Logger.info.apply(this, arguments); // or

// After
console.info(...arguments);
```

### Within the framework

Remove the following direct uses of `Ember.Logger` from the ember.js and
ember-data projects:

* `ember-debug`:
    *  deprecate (`ember-debug\lib\deprecate.js`) - `Logger.warn`
    *  debug (`ember-debug\lib\index.js`) - `Logger.info`
    *  warn (`ember-debug\lib\warn.js`) - `Logger.warn`
* `ember-routing` (`ember-routing\lib\system\router.js`):
    *  transitioned to - `Logger.log`
    *  preparing to transition to - `Logger.log`
    *  intermediate-transitioned to - `Logger.log`
* `ember-testing`:
    *  Testing paused (`ember-testing\lib\helpers\pause_test.js`) - `Logger.info`
    *  Catch-all handler (`ember-testing\lib\test\adapter.js`) - `Logger.error`
* `ember-data`:
    *  `tests\test-helper.js`- `Logger.log`

Adjust all test code that redirects logging and sets it back:

* `ember\tests\routing\basic_test.js` (adjust)
* `ember-application\tests\system\dependency_injection\default_resolver_test.js` (adjust)
* `ember-application\tests\system\logging_test.js` (remove?)
* `ember-glimmer\tests\integration\helpers\log-test.js` (remove?)

Note: None of the uses of `Ember.Logger` in `ember.js` or `ember-data` involve
`Ember.debug`, so that issue doesn't affect the Ember.js code directly.

Add deprecation warnings to the implementation: `ember-console\lib\index.js`.
Bear in mind that `Ember.deprecate` in `ember-debug` currently calls
`Logger.warn`, so the `ember-debug` code should be changed _first_ or adding
the deprecation warning will create a deep recursion.

The `Ember.assert`, `Ember.warn`, `Ember.info`, `Ember.debug`, and
`Ember.deprecate` methods suppress their output on production builds.
However, they are suppressing them in the `ember-debug` module, which
currently consumes `Ember.Logger`, _not_ by `Ember.Logger` itself. Hence,
replacing calls to `Ember.Logger` with direct calls to the console will not
affect this behavior.

### Add-On Developers

The following high-impact add-ons (9 or 10 or a * on EmberObserver) use
`Ember.Logger` and should probably be given an early heads-up to adjust
their code to use `console` before this RFC is implemented. This will limit
the level of pain that their users experience when the deprecation is released.

Add-ons that need to also support Ember 2.x will need to make their console
references conditional on console being "truthy", of course, to support Internet
Explorer 9.

In the order of their number of references to `Ember.Logger`:

* `ember-concurrency` (15)
* `ember-cli-deprecation-workflow` (9)
* `ember-stripe-service` (9)
* `semantic-ui-ember` (7)
* `ember-resolver` (6)
* `ember-cli-page-object` (4)
* `ember-cli-sentry` (3)
* `ember-islands` (3)
* `ember-states` (3)
* `ember-cli-pagination` (2)
* `ember-cli-clipboard` (1)
* `ember-cli-fastboot` (1)
* `ember-elsewhere` (1)
* `ember-i18n` (1)
* `ember-simple-auth-token` (1)
* `ember-svg-jar` (1)
* `liquid-fire` (1)

## How we teach this

### Communication of change

We need to inform users that `Ember.Logger` will be deprecated and in what
release it will occur.

### Official code bases and documentation

We do not currently actively teach the use of `Ember.Logger`. We will need to
remove any passing references to `Ember.Logger` from the Ember guides
from the Super Rentals tutorial, and anywhere else it appears on the website.

Once it is gone from the code, we also need to verify it no longer appears in
the API listings.

We must provide an entry in the deprecation guide for this change:
* describing relevant divergences remaining in the handling of the console in
Internet Explorer 11 and Edge browsers.
* describing the issue with using console.debug on node versions
earlier than Node 9.
* describing alternative ways of dealing with eslint's `no-console` messages.

## Drawbacks

191 add-ons in Ember Inspector are using `Ember.Logger`. It has been there and
documented for a long time. So this deprecation will cause some level of change
on many projects.

This, of course, can be said for almost any deprecation, and Ember's
disciplined approach to deprecation has been repeatedly shown to ease things.
These particular changes are proving easy to locate and replace by hand. Also,
only twenty of those add-ons have more than six references to `Ember.Logger`.
If this is characteristic of the user base, the level of effort to make
the change, even by hand, should be very small for most users.

Those using `Logger.debug` as something different from `Logger.log` may have
at least a theoretical concern. Under the covers `Logger.debug` only calls
`console.debug` if it exists, calling `console.log` otherwise. The only
platform where the difference between the two is visible in the console is on
Safari. We can encourage folks with a tangible, practical concern about this to
speak up during the comment period, but I don't anticipate this will have much
impact.

## Alternatives

1. Leave things as they are, perhaps providing an `@ember/console` module
interface.

2. Extract `Ember.Logger` into its own (tiny) `@ember/console` package as
a shim for users.

## Unresolved questions

None at this point. The answers from prior drafts have been promoted into the text.
