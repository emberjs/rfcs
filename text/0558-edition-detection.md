# Edition detection

## Summary

Introduces a mechanism that an application can use to specify which Edition of
Ember it intends to target. This RFC will define:

* How to specify the edition that the application is using
* How other packages (addons, codemods, etc) can detect the applications intended edition
* What the edition should be used for

## Motivation

As Ember approaches its first edition (see
[emberjs/rfcs#364](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/364)) various addons
need to modify their behavior based on the edition that is being used. An
initial implementation (done without RFC) used the `setEdition` method from
`@ember/edition-utils` inside the application or addon's `.ember-cli.js`
file to specify which edition to use. That implementation worked well
enough throughout the intial preview period, but a number of major issues were
(rightfully!) surfaced by the community:

1. it seems unnecessary/redundant
2. it's not clear what this flag actually does (likely due to having no RFC!)
3. it's not statically analyzable (and therefore cannot be used by things like codemods)

This RFC will review these issues in light of the updated implementation,
showing how each of the concerns have been met.

## Detailed design

### Specifying the edition

A new entry will be added to the project's `package.json`:

```js
{
  "name": "project-name",
  // ...snip
  "ember": {
    "edition": "octane"
  }
}
```

The value will be expected to be one of the valid edition names (currently
`classic` and `octane`). Using the `package.json` for this allows us to ensure
that the value is statically analyzable and easy to discover.

For applications specifying `ember: { edition: 'octane' }` in `package.json` is
generally all that is needed. In an addon this new property would be specifying
the edition that the addons own dummy app uses. However, many addons may want
to test against _multiple_ editions that they support. In order to support
this, ember-try will be updated to allow specifying (and merging) the `ember`
property in the `package.json` from their `config/ember-try.js` scenarios.

### Valid use of the edition value

The edition flag should only be used by addons to determine what blueprint
output to generate and to provide helpful warnings (or errors) at build time.

Note that the above definition does **not** allow for an addon to detect the
edition configuration and change its fundamental implementation. This is quite
intentional!

Instead, addons should rely on feature detection techniques like the following
to alter implementations:

* Check to see if given methods/properties exist (this is essentially like how
  browser polyfills work)
* Use a tool like
[ember-compatibility-helpers](https://github.com/pzuraq/ember-compatibility-helpers)'s
`gte` method (e.g. `if (gte('ember-source', '3.14.0')) { }`)
* Use
  [@ember/optional-features](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-optional-features)'s
  [`isFeatureEnabled`
  method](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-optional-features#at-build-time-from-an-addon)

### Detecting the edition

The existing `@ember/edition-utils` package will still be used by addons to
detect which edition is in use, but it will be updated to check the new
location (instead of relying on folks leveraging `setEdition`).

The API documentation for `@ember/edition-utils` would be:

```ts
module '@ember/edition-utils' {
  /**
    Determine if the application that is running is running under a given Ember
    Edition.  When the edition in use is _newer_ than the requested edition it
    will return `true`, and if the edition in use by the application is _older_
    than the requested edition it will return `false`.

    @param {string} requestedEditionName the Edition name that the application/addon is requesting
    @param {string} [projectRoot=process.cwd()] the base directory of the project
  */
  has(requestedEditionName: string, projectRoot?: string): boolean;

  /**
    Sets the Edition that the application should be considered a part of.
    This method is deprecated, and will be phased out in the next major release.

    @deprecated
  */
  setEdition(editionName: string): void;
}
```

For a period of time the `@ember/edition-utils` package will continue to
support existing users of `setEdition` when an edition is not detected via the
new mechanism. This allows users that have been testing out Ember Octane
(either via the `@ember/octane-app-blueprint` or manually using `setEdition` in
their `.ember-cli.js`) a period of time in order to migrate.

## How we teach this

The official guides at `https://guides.emberjs.com/release/configuring-ember/`
will be updated to include documentation of the new `package.json`
configuration and clearly explain what the edition flag is used for (warnings
and blueprints).

This will not be a difficult concept to teach to folks (most users won't
care, and will get upgraded as part of a future `ember-cli` blueprint update).

## Drawbacks

> Changing existing app and addon usage of the prior flag will cause churn.

This is significantly mitigated by ensuring that `@ember/edition-utils`
continues to support users of `setEdition` API as a fallback (with a
deprecation), and that the existing `has` API continues to work (defaulting the
project root to the current working directory).

## Alternatives

### Use `emberEdition` in `package.json`

Some folks may prefer to use a single new property in `package.json` (vs the
`"ember": { "edition": "octane" }` setup proposed above). I personally think it
makes more sense to start with an `"ember":` key, as there are additional
possible usages (e.g. moving `"ember-addon"` configuration to be within
`"ember"`) and migrating from `emberEdition` to the nested syntax would be
needless churn.

### Use `.ember-cli` instead of `package.json`

Instead of adding the `emberEdition` value to the `package.json` we could add
it to the existing `.ember-cli` file. However, doing this would **not** satisfy
the static analysis constraint mentioned in the motivation section (because
`.ember-cli.js` is transparently supported by `ember-cli`'s build system).
In addition, any values that are included in `.ember-cli` are automatically
passed in to every command invocation which would be both unintended (we don't
want commands to access the edition in this way) and possibly breaking (if the
command already accepted an option with whatever value we chose).

## Unresolved questions

TBD?
