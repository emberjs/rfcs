# Summary

In order to largely reduce the brittleness of tests, this RFC proposes to
remove the concept of artificially restricting the resolver used under
testing.

# Motivation

Disabling the resolver while running tests leads to extremely brittle tests.

It is not possible for collaborators to be added to the object (or one
of its dependencies) under test, without modifying the test itself (even if
exactly the same API is exposed).

The ability to restrict the resolver is **not** actually a feature of Ember's
container/registry/resolver system, and has posed as significant maintenance
challenge throughout the lifetime of ember-test-helpers.

Removing this system of restriction will make choosing what kind of test to
be used easier, simplify many of the blueprints, and enable much simpler refactoring
of an applications components/controllers/routes/etc to use collaborating utilties
and services.

# Transition Path

## Deprecate Functionality

Issue a deprecation if `integration: true` is not included in the specified
options for the APIs listed below. This specifically includes specifying
`unit: true`, `needs: []`, or specifying none of the "test type options"
(`unit`, `needs`, or `integration` options) to the following `ember-qunit`
and `ember-mocha` API's:

* `ember-qunit`
  * `moduleFor`
  * `moduleForComponent`
  * `moduleForModel`
* `ember-mocha`
  * `setupTest`
  * `setupComponentTest`
  * `setupModelTest`

### Non Component Test APIs

The migration path for `moduleFor`, `moduleForModel`, `setupTest`, and
`setupModelTest` is very simple:

```js
// ember-qunit

// before
moduleFor('service:session');

moduleFor('service:session', {
  unit: true
});

moduleFor('service:session', {
  needs: ['type:thing']
});

// after
moduleFor('service:session', {
  integration: true
});
```

```js
// ember-mocha

// before
describe('Session Service', function() {
  setupTest('service:session');

  // ...snip...
});

describe('Session Service', function() {
  setupTest('service:session', { unit: true });

  // ...snip...
});

describe('Session Service', function() {
  setupTest('service:session', { needs: [] });

  // ...snip...
});

// after

describe('Session Service', function() {
  setupTest('service:session', { integration: true });

  // ...snip...
});
```

The main change is adding `integration: true` to options (and removing `unit` or `needs`
if present).

### Component Test APIs

Implicitly relying on "unit test mode" has been deprecated for quite some time
([introduced 2015-04-07](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-test-helpers/pull/38)),
so all consumers of `moduleForComponent` and `setupComponentTest` are specifying
one of the "test type options" (`unit`, `needs`, or `integration`).

This RFC proposes to deprecate completely using `unit` or `needs` options with
`moduleForComponent` and `setupComponentTest`. The vast majority of component tests
should be testing via `moduleForComponent` / `setupComponentTest` with the `integration: true`
option set, but on some rare occaisions it is easier to use the "unit test" style is
desired (e.g. non-rendering test) these tests should be migrated to using `moduleFor`
/ `setupTest` directly.

```js
// ember-qunit

// before
moduleForComponent('display-page', {
  unit: true
});

moduleForComponent('display-page', {
  needs: ['type:thing']
});

// after

moduleFor('component:display-page', {
  integration: true
});
```

```js
// ember-mocha
describe('DisplayPageComponent', function() {
  setupComponentTest('display-page', { unit: true });

  // ...snip...
});

describe('DisplayPageComponent', function() {
  setupComponentTest('display-page', { needs: [] });

  // ...snip...
});

// after

describe('DisplayPageComponent', function() {
  setupTest('component:display-page', { integration: true });

  // ...snip...
});
```

## Ecosystem Updates

The blueprints in all official projects (and any provided by popular
addons) will need to be updated to avoid triggering a deprecation.

This includes:

* `ember-source`
* `ember-data`
* `ember-cli-legacy-blueprints`
* Others?

## Remove Deprecated `unit` / `needs` Options

Once the changes from this RFC are made, we will be able to remove
support for the `unit` and `needs` options from `ember-test-helpers`,
`ember-qunit`, and `ember-mocha`. This would be a "semver major"
version bump for all of the related libraries to properly signal that
functionality was removed.

Once the underlying libraries have done a major version bump, we will
introduce a deprecation for using the `integration` option. This
deprecation would be issued once for the entire test suite (not once
per test module which has `integration` passed in). We will also update
the blueprints to remove the extraneous `integration` option.

# How We Teach This

This RFC would require an audit of the main Ember.js guides to ensure
that all usages of the APIs in question continue to be non-deprecated
valid usages.

# Drawbacks

## Churn

One drawback to this deprecation proposal is the churn associated with
modifying the options passed for each test. This can almost certainly
be mitigated by providing a codemod to enable automated updating.

There are additional changes being entertained that would require changes
for the default testing blueprints, we should ensure that these RFCs do not
conflict or cause undue churn/pain.

## `integration: true` Confusion

Prior to this deprecation we had essentially 4 options for testing components:

* `moduleFor(..., { unit: true })`
* `moduleFor(..., { integration: true })`
* `moduleForComponent(..., { unit: true })`
* `moduleForComponent(..., { integatrion: true })`

With this RFC the option `integration` no longer provides value (we aren't talking
about "unit" vs "integration" tests), and may be seen as confusing.

I believe that this concern is mitigated by the ultimate removal of the `integration`
(it is only required in order to allow us a path forward that is compatible with
todays ember-qunit/ember-mocha versions).
