# Add Resources as a Reactive Primitive

## Summary

Resources are a reactive primitive that enables managing stateful processes with cleanup logic as reactive values. They unify concepts like custom helpers, modifiers, and services by providing a consistent pattern for expressing values that have lifecycles and may require cleanup when their owner is destroyed.

## Motivation

Ember's current Octane programming model provides excellent primitives for reactive state (`@tracked`), declarative rendering (templates), and component lifecycle, but it lacks a unified primitive for managing stateful processes that need cleanup. This gap leads to several problems:

### Current Pain Points

**1. Scattered Lifecycle Management**
Today, managing stateful processes requires spreading setup and cleanup across component lifecycle hooks:

```js
export default class TimerComponent extends Component {
  @tracked time = new Date();
  timer = null;

  constructor() {
    super(...arguments);
    this.timer = setInterval(() => {
      this.time = new Date();
    }, 1000);
  }

  willDestroy() {
    if (this.timer) {
      clearInterval(this.timer);
    }
  }
}
```

This pattern has several issues:
- Setup and cleanup logic are separated across the component lifecycle
- It's easy to forget cleanup, leading to memory leaks
- The logic is tied to component granularity
- Testing requires instantiating entire components

**2. Reactive Cleanup Complexity**
When tracked data changes, manually managing cleanup of dependent processes is error-prone:

```js
export default class DataLoader extends Component {
  @tracked url;
  controller = null;

  @cached
  get request() {
    // Need to manually handle cleanup when URL changes
    this.controller?.abort();
    this.controller = new AbortController();
    
    return fetch(this.url, { signal: this.controller.signal });
  }

  willDestroy() {
    this.controller?.abort();
  }
}
```

**3. Code Organization and Reusability**
Business logic becomes tightly coupled to components, making it hard to:
- Extract and reuse patterns across components
- Test logic in isolation
- Compose smaller pieces into larger functionality

**4. Lack of Unified Abstraction**
Ember has several overlapping concepts that solve similar problems:
- Custom helpers for derived values
- Modifiers for DOM lifecycle management  
- Services for shared state
- Component lifecycle hooks for cleanup

Each uses different APIs and patterns, creating cognitive overhead and preventing a unified mental model.

### What Resources Solve

Resources provide a unified primitive that:

1. **Co-locates setup and cleanup logic** in a single function
2. **Automatically handles reactive cleanup** when dependencies change
3. **Enables fine-grained composition** independent of component boundaries
4. **Provides a consistent abstraction** for all stateful processes with cleanup
5. **Improves testability** by separating concerns from component lifecycle

Resources allow developers to model any stateful process as a reactive value with an optional cleanup lifecycle, unifying concepts across the framework while maintaining Ember's declarative, reactive programming model.

## Detailed design

### Overview

A **resource** is a reactive function that represents a value with lifecycle and optional cleanup logic. Resources are created using the `resource()` function and automatically manage their lifecycle through Ember's existing destroyable system.

```js
import { cell, resource } from '@ember/reactive';

const Clock = resource(({ on }) => {
  const time = cell(new Date());
  
  const timer = setInterval(() => {
    time.set(new Date());
  }, 1000);

  on.cleanup(() => clearInterval(timer));

  return time;
});
```

### Core API

The `resource()` function takes a single argument: a function that receives a ResourceAPI object and returns a reactive value.

```ts
interface ResourceAPI {
  on: {
    cleanup: (destructor: () => void) => void;
  };
  use: <T>(resource: T) => ReactiveValue<T>;
  owner: Owner;
}

type ResourceFunction<T> = (api: ResourceAPI) => T;

function resource<T>(fn: ResourceFunction<T>): Resource<T>
```

### Resource Creation and Usage

Resources can be used in several ways:

**1. In Templates (as helpers)**
```js
import { cell, resource } from '@ember/reactive';

const Clock = resource(({ on }) => {
  const time = cell(new Date());
  const timer = setInterval(() => time.set(new Date()), 1000);
  on.cleanup(() => clearInterval(timer));
  return time;
});

// In template
<template>Current time: {{Clock}}</template>
```

**2. With the `@use` decorator**
```js
import { use } from '@ember/reactive';

export default class MyComponent extends Component {
  @use clock = Clock;
  
  <template>Time: {{this.clock}}</template>
}
```

The `@use` decorator is an ergonomic shorthand that automatically invokes any value with a registered helper manager. This means that `Clock` (which has a resource helper manager) gets automatically invoked when accessed, eliminating the need to call it explicitly or access `.current`. This works for resources, but also for any other construct that has registered a helper manager via `setHelperManager` from RFC 625 and RFC 756.

**Convention: Function Wrapping for Clarity**

While `@use clock = Clock` works, assigning a value via `@use` can look unusual since no invocation is apparent. By convention, it's more appropriate to wrap resources in a function so that the invocation site clearly indicates that behavior:

```js
// Preferred: Clear that invocation/behavior is occurring
@use clock = Clock()

// Works but less clear: Looks like simple assignment
@use clock = Clock
```

This convention makes the code more readable and aligns with the expectation that decorators like `@use` are performing some active behavior rather than passive assignment.

#### Helper Manager Integration and the `@use` Decorator

The `@use` decorator builds upon Ember's existing helper manager infrastructure (RFC 625 and RFC 756) to provide automatic invocation of values with registered helper managers. When a resource is created with `resource()`, it receives a helper manager that makes it invokable in templates and enables the `@use` decorator's automatic behavior.

Here's how it works:

```js
// A resource has a helper manager registered
const Clock = resource(({ on }) => {
  // ... resource implementation
});

// The @use decorator detects the helper manager and automatically invokes it
@use clock = Clock; // Equivalent to: clock = Clock()

// Without @use, you need explicit invocation or .current access
clock = use(this, Clock); // Returns reactive value, need .current
clock = Clock(); // Direct invocation in template context
```

The `@use` decorator pattern extends beyond resources to work with any construct that has registered a helper manager. This means that future primitives that integrate with the helper manager system (like certain kinds of computed values, cached functions, or other reactive constructs) will automatically work with `@use` without any changes to the decorator itself.

**Helper Manager vs Direct Invocation:**

When using resources in templates directly (e.g., `{{Clock}}`), the helper manager handles the invocation automatically. The `@use` decorator brings this same ergonomic benefit to class properties, bridging the gap between template usage and class-based usage patterns.

**3. With the `use()` function**
```js
export default class MyComponent extends Component {
  clock = use(this, Clock);
  
  <template>Time: {{this.clock.current}}</template>
}
```

The `use()` function provides manual resource instantiation when you need more control over the lifecycle or want to avoid the automatic invocation behavior of `@use`.

**4. Manual instantiation (for library authors)**
```js
const clockBuilder = resource(() => { /* ... */ });
const owner = getOwner(this);
const clockInstance = clockBuilder.create();
clockInstance.link(owner);
const currentTime = clockInstance.current;
```

### Resource API Details

**`on.cleanup(destructor)`**

Registers a cleanup function that will be called when the resource is destroyed. This happens automatically when:
- The owning context (component, service, etc.) is destroyed
- The resource re-runs due to tracked data changes
- The resource is manually destroyed

```js
const DataLoader = resource(({ on }) => {
  const controller = new AbortController();
  const state = cell({ loading: true });

  on.cleanup(() => controller.abort());

  fetch('/api/data', { signal: controller.signal })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => state.set({ loading: false, data }))
    .catch(error => state.set({ loading: false, error }));

  return state;
});
```

**`use(resource)` - Resource Composition**

The `use()` method within a resource function allows composition of resources by consuming other resources with proper lifecycle management. This is different from the top-level `use()` function and the `@use` decorator:

```js
const Now = resource(({ on }) => {
  const time = cell(new Date());
  const timer = setInterval(() => time.set(new Date()), 1000);
  on.cleanup(() => clearInterval(timer));
  return time;
});

const FormattedTime = resource(({ use }) => {
  const time = use(Now);
  return () => time.current.toLocaleTimeString();
});
```

### Key Differences Between Usage Patterns

**Understanding `@use` as an Ergonomic Shorthand**

The `@use` decorator is fundamentally an ergonomic convenience that builds upon Ember's existing helper manager infrastructure. When you apply `@use` to a property, it doesn't assign the value directlyâ€”instead, like `@tracked`, it replaces the property with a getter that provides lazy evaluation and automatic invocation.

```js
export default class MyComponent extends Component {
  // This:
  @use clock = Clock;
  
  // Is equivalent to defining a getter that automatically invokes
  // any value with a registered helper manager:
  get clock() {
    // Detect helper manager and invoke automatically
    if (hasHelperManager(Clock)) {
      return invokeHelper(this, Clock);
    }
    return Clock;
  }
}
```

This getter-based approach enables several key benefits:
- **Lazy instantiation**: The resource is only created when first accessed
- **Automatic lifecycle management**: The resource is tied to the component's lifecycle
- **Transparent integration**: Works seamlessly with any construct that has a helper manager

**`@use` decorator vs resource `use()` vs top-level `use()`:**

1. **`@use` decorator** - An ergonomic shorthand that leverages Ember's helper manager system:
   - Replaces the property with a getter (like `@tracked`) for lazy access
   - Automatically invokes values with registered helper managers (RFC 625/756)
   - Works with resources, but also any construct that has a helper manager
   - Returns the "unwrapped" value directly (no `.current` needed)
   - Best for when you want the simplest possible API with automatic lifecycle management

2. **Resource `use()` method** - For resource composition within resource functions:
   - Available only within the resource function's API object
   - Manages lifecycle and cleanup of nested resources automatically
   - Returns a reactive value that can be consumed with `.current`
   - Essential for building complex resources from simpler ones
   - Enables hierarchical resource composition with proper cleanup chains

3. **Top-level `use()` function** - For manual control:
   - Requires explicit owner/context management
   - Returns a reactive value requiring `.current` access
   - Useful when you need fine-grained control over instantiation timing
   - Primarily for library authors or advanced use cases where automatic behavior isn't desired

**`owner`**

Provides access to the Ember owner for dependency injection:

```js
const UserSession = resource(({ owner }) => {
  const session = owner.lookup('service:session');
  const router = owner.lookup('service:router');
  
  return () => ({
    user: session.currentUser,
    route: router.currentRouteName
  });
});
```

### Resource Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: When a resource is first accessed, its function is invoked
2. **Reactivity**: If the resource function reads tracked data, it will re-run when that data changes
3. **Cleanup**: Before re-running or when destroyed, all registered cleanup functions are called
4. **Destruction**: When the owning context is destroyed, the resource and all its cleanup functions are invoked

### Type Definitions

```ts
interface ResourceAPI {
  on: {
    cleanup: (destructor: () => void) => void;
  };
  use: <T>(resource: T) => ReactiveValue<T>;
  owner: Owner;
}

type ResourceFunction<T> = (api: ResourceAPI) => T;

interface Resource<T> {
  create(): ResourceInstance<T>;
}

interface ResourceInstance<T> {
  current: T;
  link(context: object): void;
}

function resource<T>(fn: ResourceFunction<T>): Resource<T>;
function use<T>(context: object, resource: Resource<T>): ReactiveValue<T>;
function use<T>(resource: Resource<T>): PropertyDecorator;
```

### Relationship to the Cell Primitive

While the `cell` primitive (RFC 1071) is not strictly required for resources to function, resources are significantly more ergonomic and powerful when used together with `cell`. Resources can work with Ember's existing `@tracked` properties, but `cell` provides several advantages:

**Without `cell` (using `@tracked`):**
```js
import { resource } from '@ember/reactive';
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';

const Clock = resource(({ on }) => {
  // Must create a separate class to hold tracked state
  class ClockState {
    @tracked time = new Date();
  }
  
  const state = new ClockState();
  
  const timer = setInterval(() => {
    state.time = new Date();
  }, 1000);

  on.cleanup(() => clearInterval(timer));

  return () => state.time;
});

// Usage requires property access
<template>Current time: {{Clock}}</template>
```

**With `cell` (more ergonomic):**
```js
import { cell, resource } from '@ember/reactive';

const Clock = resource(({ on }) => {
  const time = cell(new Date());
  
  const timer = setInterval(() => {
    time.set(new Date());
  }, 1000);

  on.cleanup(() => clearInterval(timer));

  return time; // Consumer gets the cell directly
});

// Usage is more direct
<template>Current time: {{Clock}}</template>
```

**Key advantages of using `cell` with resources:**

1. **Simpler State Management**: No need to create wrapper classes for tracked properties
2. **Direct Value Returns**: Resources can return cells directly rather than objects with tracked properties
3. **Cleaner APIs**: Consumers get more intuitive interfaces without property access
4. **Better Composition**: Resources that return cells compose more naturally with other resources

While resources provide significant value on their own by solving lifecycle management and cleanup, the combination with `cell` creates a more complete and developer-friendly reactive primitive system.

### Integration with Existing Systems

**Helper Manager Integration**

Resources integrate with Ember's existing helper manager system. The `resource()` function returns a value that can be used directly in templates through the helper invocation syntax.

**Destroyable Integration**

Resources automatically integrate with Ember's destroyable system via `associateDestroyableChild()`, ensuring proper cleanup when parent contexts are destroyed.

**Ownership Integration**

Resources receive the owner from their parent context, enabling dependency injection and integration with existing Ember services and systems.

**Relationship to the Cell Primitive**

While this RFC does not strictly depend on the `cell` primitive from RFC 1071, resources become significantly more ergonomic when used together with `cell`. Resources can work with any reactive primitive, including existing `@tracked` properties and `@cached` getters, but `cell` provides several advantages:

1. **Function-based APIs**: Resources are function-based, and `cell` provides a function-based reactive primitive that composes naturally
2. **Encapsulated state**: Unlike `@tracked` which requires classes, `cell` allows creating reactive state without class overhead
3. **Immediate updates**: `cell` provides both getter and setter APIs (`cell.current` and `cell.set()`) that work well in resource contexts

Without `cell`, developers would need to either:
- Use classes with `@tracked` properties (heavier abstraction)
- Manually manage reactivity with lower-level tracking APIs
- Return functions from resources that close over mutable state

Example comparison:

```js
// With cell (ergonomic)
const Clock = resource(({ on }) => {
  const time = cell(new Date());
  const timer = setInterval(() => time.set(new Date()), 1000);
  on.cleanup(() => clearInterval(timer));
  return time;
});

// Without cell (more verbose)
const Clock = resource(({ on }) => {
  let currentTime = new Date();
  const timer = setInterval(() => {
    currentTime = new Date();
    // Manual invalidation needed
  }, 1000);
  on.cleanup(() => clearInterval(timer));
  
  return () => currentTime; // Must return function for reactivity
});
```

Therefore, while `cell` is not a hard dependency, implementing both RFCs together would provide the best developer experience.

### Advanced Reactive Concepts

Ember's resource primitive embodies several advanced reactivity concepts that position it as a modern, best-in-class reactive abstraction. Understanding these concepts helps developers leverage resources most effectively and appreciate how they fit into the broader reactive ecosystem.

#### Evaluation Models: Lazy by Default, Scheduled When Needed

Resources follow a **lazy evaluation model** by default, meaning they are only created and evaluated when their value is actually consumed. This aligns with the principle that expensive computations should only occur when their results are needed:

```js
const ExpensiveComputation = resource(({ on }) => {
  console.log('This only runs when accessed'); // Lazy evaluation
  const result = cell(performExpensiveCalculation());
  return result;
});

// Resource not created yet
@use expensiveData = ExpensiveComputation; 

// Only now is the resource created and evaluated
<template>{{this.expensiveData}}</template>
```

However, certain types of resources benefit from **scheduled evaluation**, particularly those that involve side effects or async operations:

```js
const DataFetcher = resource(({ on }) => {
  const state = cell({ loading: true });
  
  // Side effect happens immediately (scheduled evaluation)
  // to avoid waterfalls when multiple async resources are composed
  fetchData().then(data => state.set({ loading: false, data }));
  
  return state;
});
```

This hybrid approachâ€”lazy by default, scheduled when beneficialâ€”provides optimal performance while avoiding common pitfalls like request waterfalls in async scenarios.

#### Reactive Ownership and Automatic Disposal

Resources implement **reactive ownership**, a pattern pioneered by fine-grained reactive systems, which enables automatic memory management without manual disposal:

```js
const ParentResource = resource(({ use, on }) => {
  // Child resources are automatically owned by parent
  const child1 = use(SomeChildResource);
  const child2 = use(AnotherChildResource);
  
  // When ParentResource is destroyed, all children are automatically cleaned up
  // This creates a disposal tree similar to component hierarchies
  
  return () => ({
    data1: child1.current,
    data2: child2.current
  });
});
```

The ownership model ensures that:
- **No Memory Leaks**: Child resources are automatically disposed when parents are destroyed
- **Hierarchical Cleanup**: Disposal propagates down through the resource tree
- **Automatic Lifecycle**: No manual `willDestroy` or cleanup management needed
- **Composable Boundaries**: Resources can create isolated ownership scopes

#### Push-Pull Reactivity and Glitch-Free Consistency

Resources participate in Ember's **push-pull reactive system**, which combines the benefits of both push-based (event-driven) and pull-based (demand-driven) reactivity:

```js
const DerivedValue = resource(({ use }) => {
  const source1 = use(SourceA);
  const source2 = use(SourceB);
  
  // This derivation is guaranteed to be glitch-free:
  // When SourceA changes, this won't re-run with stale SourceB data
  return () => source1.current + source2.current;
});
```

**Push Phase**: When tracked data changes, notifications propagate down the dependency graph, marking potentially affected resources as "dirty."

**Pull Phase**: When a value is actually consumed (in templates, effects, etc.), the system pulls fresh values up the dependency chain, ensuring all intermediate values are consistent.

This approach guarantees **glitch-free consistency**â€”user code never observes intermediate or inconsistent states during reactive updates.

#### Phased Execution and Ember's Rendering Lifecycle

Resources integrate seamlessly with Ember's three-phase execution model:

1. **Pure Phase**: Resource functions run and compute derived values
2. **Render Phase**: Template rendering consumes resource values
3. **Post-Render Phase**: Effects and cleanup logic execute

```js
const UIResource = resource(({ on, use }) => {
  // PURE PHASE: Calculations and data preparation
  const data = use(DataSource);
  const formattedData = () => formatForDisplay(data.current);
  
  // RENDER PHASE: Template consumes formattedData
  
  // POST-RENDER PHASE: Side effects via cleanup
  on.cleanup(() => {
    // Analytics, logging, or other side effects
    trackResourceUsage('UIResource', data.current);
  });
  
  return formattedData;
});
```

This phased approach ensures predictable execution order and enables advanced features like React's concurrent rendering patterns.

#### The Principle: "What Can Be Derived, Should Be Derived"

Resources embody the fundamental reactive principle that **state should be minimized and derived values should be maximized**. This leads to more predictable, testable, and maintainable applications:

```js
// AVOID: Manual state synchronization
const BadPattern = resource(({ on }) => {
  const firstName = cell('John');
  const lastName = cell('Doe');
  const fullName = cell(''); // Redundant state!
  
  // Manual synchronization - error prone
  on.cleanup(() => {
    // Complex logic to keep fullName in sync...
  });
  
  return { firstName, lastName, fullName };
});

// PREFER: Derived values
const GoodPattern = resource(() => {
  const firstName = cell('John');
  const lastName = cell('Doe');
  
  // Derived value - always consistent
  const fullName = () => `${firstName.current} ${lastName.current}`;
  
  return { firstName, lastName, fullName };
});
```

Resources make it natural to follow this principle by:
- **Encouraging functional composition** through the `use()` method
- **Making derivation explicit** through return values
- **Automating consistency** through reactive dependencies
- **Eliminating manual synchronization** through automatic re-evaluation

#### Async Resources and Colorless Async

For async operations, resources support **colorless async**â€”patterns where async and sync values can be treated uniformly without pervasive `async`/`await` coloring:

```js
const AsyncData = resource(({ on }) => {
  const state = cell({ loading: true, data: null, error: null });
  const controller = new AbortController();
  
  on.cleanup(() => controller.abort());
  
  fetchData({ signal: controller.signal })
    .then(data => state.set({ loading: false, data, error: null }))
    .catch(error => state.set({ loading: false, data: null, error }));
  
  return state;
});

// Usage is the same whether data is sync or async
const ProcessedData = resource(({ use }) => {
  const asyncData = use(AsyncData);
  
  // No async/await needed - just reactive composition
  return () => {
    const { loading, data, error } = asyncData.current;
    if (loading) return 'Loading...';
    if (error) return `Error: ${error.message}`;
    return processData(data);
  };
});
```

This approach avoids the "function coloring problem" where async concerns leak throughout the application, instead containing them within specific resources while maintaining uniform composition patterns.

These advanced concepts work together to make resources not just a convenience feature, but a foundational primitive that enables sophisticated reactive architectures while remaining approachable for everyday use. By implementing these patterns, Ember's resource system positions itself at the forefront of modern reactive programming, providing developers with tools that are both powerful and intuitive.

### .current Collapsing and Function Returns

A key ergonomic feature of resources is **automatic `.current` collapsing** in templates and with the `@use` decorator. When a resource returns a `cell` or reactive value, consumers don't need to manually access `.current`:

```js
const Time = resource(({ on }) => {
  const time = cell(new Date());
  const timer = setInterval(() => time.set(new Date()), 1000);
  on.cleanup(() => clearInterval(timer));
  return time; // Returns a cell
});

// Template usage - .current is automatic
<template>Current time: {{Time}}</template>

// @use decorator - .current is automatic
export default class MyComponent extends Component {
  @use time = Time;
  
  <template>Time: {{this.time}}</template> // No .current needed
}

// Manual usage - .current is explicit
export default class MyComponent extends Component {
  time = use(this, Time);
  
  <template>Time: {{this.time.current}}</template> // .current needed
}
```

**Alternative Pattern: Function Returns**

Resources can also return functions instead of cells, which provides a different composition pattern:

```js
const FormattedTime = resource(({ use }) => {
  const time = use(Time);
  
  // Return a function that computes the formatted time
  return () => time.current.toLocaleTimeString();
});

// Usage is identical regardless of return type
<template>Formatted: {{FormattedTime}}</template>
```

Function returns are particularly useful for:
- **Derived computations** that transform reactive values
- **Conditional logic** that depends on multiple reactive sources
- **Complex formatting** or data transformation
- **Memoization patterns** where you want to control when computation occurs

The choice between returning cells and returning functions depends on whether the resource primarily holds state (use cells) or computes derived values (use functions).

### Example Use Cases

**1. Data Fetching with Modern Async Patterns**
```js
const RemoteData = resource(({ on }) => {
  const state = cell({ loading: true, data: null, error: null });
  const controller = new AbortController();

  on.cleanup(() => controller.abort());

  // Scheduled evaluation - fetch starts immediately to avoid waterfalls
  fetch(this.args.url, { signal: controller.signal })
    .then(response => {
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}: ${response.statusText}`);
      }
      return response.json();
    })
    .then(data => state.set({ loading: false, data, error: null }))
    .catch(error => {
      // Only update state if the request wasn't aborted
      if (!controller.signal.aborted) {
        state.set({ loading: false, data: null, error });
      }
    });

  return state;
});

// Composable data processing - avoids request waterfalls
const ProcessedData = resource(({ use }) => {
  const rawData = use(RemoteData);
  
  return () => {
    const { loading, data, error } = rawData.current;
    
    if (loading) return { status: 'loading' };
    if (error) return { status: 'error', message: error.message };
    
    return {
      status: 'success',
      processedData: data.map(item => ({
        ...item,
        timestamp: new Date(item.createdAt).toLocaleDateString()
      }))
    };
  };
});
```

**2. WebSocket Connection with Reactive State Management**
```js
const WebSocketConnection = resource(({ on, owner }) => {
  const notifications = owner.lookup('service:notifications');
  const connectionState = cell({ 
    status: 'connecting',
    lastMessage: null,
    errorCount: 0 
  });
  
  const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');
  
  socket.addEventListener('open', () => {
    connectionState.set({ 
      status: 'connected', 
      lastMessage: null, 
      errorCount: 0 
    });
  });
  
  socket.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
    const message = JSON.parse(event.data);
    connectionState.set({
      ...connectionState.current,
      lastMessage: message,
      status: 'connected'
    });
    notifications.add(message);
  });
  
  socket.addEventListener('error', () => {
    const current = connectionState.current;
    connectionState.set({
      ...current,
      status: 'error',
      errorCount: current.errorCount + 1
    });
  });
  
  socket.addEventListener('close', () => {
    connectionState.set({
      ...connectionState.current,
      status: 'disconnected'
    });
  });

  on.cleanup(() => {
    if (socket.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
      socket.close();
    }
  });

  return connectionState;
});
```

**3. Reactive DOM Event Handling with Debouncing**
```js
const WindowSize = resource(({ on }) => {
  const size = cell({
    width: window.innerWidth,
    height: window.innerHeight,
    aspectRatio: window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight
  });

  // Debounced update to avoid excessive re-renders
  let timeoutId;
  const updateSize = () => {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
      const width = window.innerWidth;
      const height = window.innerHeight;
      size.set({
        width,
        height,
        aspectRatio: width / height
      });
    }, 150);
  };

  window.addEventListener('resize', updateSize, { passive: true });
  
  on.cleanup(() => {
    window.removeEventListener('resize', updateSize);
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
  });

  return size;
});

// Derived breakpoint resource
const BreakpointInfo = resource(({ use }) => {
  const windowSize = use(WindowSize);
  
  return () => {
    const { width } = windowSize.current;
    
    if (width < 768) return { breakpoint: 'mobile', isMobile: true };
    if (width < 1024) return { breakpoint: 'tablet', isMobile: false };
    return { breakpoint: 'desktop', isMobile: false };
  };
});
```

### Best Practices and Patterns

#### Resource Composition Patterns

**Hierarchical Composition**: Build complex resources from simpler ones using reactive ownership:

```js
const UserSession = resource(({ use, owner }) => {
  const auth = owner.lookup('service:auth');
  const currentUser = use(CurrentUser);
  const preferences = use(UserPreferences);
  
  return () => ({
    user: currentUser.current,
    preferences: preferences.current,
    isAdmin: auth.hasRole('admin', currentUser.current)
  });
});

const CurrentUser = resource(({ on, owner }) => {
  const session = owner.lookup('service:session');
  const userData = cell(session.currentUser);
  
  const handleUserChange = () => userData.set(session.currentUser);
  session.on('userChanged', handleUserChange);
  on.cleanup(() => session.off('userChanged', handleUserChange));
  
  return userData;
});
```

**Parallel Data Loading**: Avoid waterfalls by composing resources that fetch independently:

```js
const DashboardData = resource(({ use }) => {
  // All three resources start fetching in parallel
  const userData = use(UserData);
  const analytics = use(AnalyticsData);
  const notifications = use(NotificationData);
  
  return () => ({
    user: userData.current,
    analytics: analytics.current,
    notifications: notifications.current,
    // Derived state based on all three
    hasUnreadNotifications: notifications.current.unreadCount > 0
  });
});
```

#### Error Handling and Resilience

**Graceful Degradation**: Design resources to handle errors gracefully:

```js
const ResilientDataLoader = resource(({ on }) => {
  const state = cell({ 
    status: 'loading',
    data: null,
    error: null,
    retryCount: 0 
  });
  
  const maxRetries = 3;
  const backoffDelay = (attempt) => Math.min(1000 * Math.pow(2, attempt), 10000);
  
  const fetchWithRetry = async (attempt = 0) => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/critical-data');
      if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}`);
      
      const data = await response.json();
      state.set({ status: 'success', data, error: null, retryCount: attempt });
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt < maxRetries) {
        const delay = backoffDelay(attempt);
        setTimeout(() => fetchWithRetry(attempt + 1), delay);
        state.set({ 
          status: 'retrying', 
          data: null, 
          error, 
          retryCount: attempt + 1 
        });
      } else {
        state.set({ status: 'failed', data: null, error, retryCount: attempt });
      }
    }
  };
  
  fetchWithRetry();
  
  return state;
});
```

#### Performance Optimization

**Lazy Evaluation for Expensive Operations**:

```js
const ExpensiveComputation = resource(({ use }) => {
  const sourceData = use(SourceData);
  
  // Use function return to defer computation until needed
  return () => {
    const data = sourceData.current;
    
    // Only compute when actually accessed
    if (data.status !== 'success') {
      return { status: data.status };
    }
    
    return {
      status: 'computed',
      result: performExpensiveAnalysis(data.data)
    };
  };
});
```

**Memoization for Stable Results**:

```js
const MemoizedProcessor = resource(({ use }) => {
  const input = use(InputData);
  let lastInput = null;
  let cachedResult = null;
  
  return () => {
    const currentInput = input.current;
    
    // Memoize based on input identity/equality
    if (currentInput !== lastInput) {
      lastInput = currentInput;
      cachedResult = expensiveProcessing(currentInput);
    }
    
    return cachedResult;
  };
});
```

#### Testing Patterns

**Resource Testing in Isolation**:

```js
import { module, test } from 'qunit';
import { setupTest } from 'ember-qunit';
import { cell } from '@ember/reactive';

module('Unit | Resource | timer', function(hooks) {
  setupTest(hooks);

  test('timer updates every second', async function(assert) {
    const TestTimer = resource(({ on }) => {
      const time = cell(new Date('2023-01-01T00:00:00'));
      let interval = 0;
      
      const timer = setInterval(() => {
        interval += 1000;
        time.set(new Date('2023-01-01T00:00:00').getTime() + interval);
      }, 100); // Faster for testing
      
      on.cleanup(() => clearInterval(timer));
      return time;
    });

    const instance = TestTimer.create();
    instance.link(this.owner);
    
    const initialTime = instance.current.current;
    
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 250));
    
    const laterTime = instance.current.current;
    assert.ok(laterTime > initialTime, 'Timer advances');
    
    instance.destroy();
  });
});
```

#### Integration Patterns

**Service Integration**:

```js
const ServiceAwareResource = resource(({ owner }) => {
  const session = owner.lookup('service:session');
  const router = owner.lookup('service:router');
  const store = owner.lookup('service:store');
  
  // Resource can depend on and coordinate multiple services
  return () => ({
    currentUser: session.currentUser,
    currentRoute: router.currentRouteName,
    // Reactive query based on current context
    relevantData: store.query('item', {
      userId: session.currentUser?.id,
      route: router.currentRouteName
    })
  });
});
```

**Cross-Resource Communication**:

```js
const NotificationBus = resource(({ on }) => {
  const subscribers = cell(new Map());
  const messages = cell([]);
  
  const subscribe = (id, callback) => {
    const current = subscribers.current;
    const newMap = new Map(current);
    newMap.set(id, callback);
    subscribers.set(newMap);
  };
  
  const publish = (message) => {
    messages.set([...messages.current, message]);
    
    // Notify all subscribers
    subscribers.current.forEach(callback => {
      callback(message);
    });
  };
  
  const unsubscribe = (id) => {
    const current = subscribers.current;
    const newMap = new Map(current);
    newMap.delete(id);
    subscribers.set(newMap);
  };
  
  return { subscribe, publish, unsubscribe, messages };
});
```

These patterns demonstrate how resources can be composed to build sophisticated reactive architectures while maintaining clarity, testability, and performance.

## Drawbacks

### Learning Curve

**Additional Abstraction**: Resources introduce a new primitive that developers must learn. While they simplify many patterns, they add to the initial cognitive load for new Ember developers.

**Advanced Reactive Concepts**: Resources embody sophisticated reactivity concepts (push-pull evaluation, reactive ownership, lazy vs scheduled evaluation) that may be overwhelming for developers new to reactive programming.

**Multiple Ways to Do Things**: Resources provide another way to manage state and side effects, potentially creating confusion about when to use components vs. services vs. resources.

**Mental Model Shifts**: Developers must learn to think in terms of "what can be derived, should be derived" and understand concepts like glitch-free consistency and automatic ownership disposal.

### Performance Considerations

**Memory Overhead**: Each resource instance maintains its own cache and cleanup tracking, which could increase memory usage in applications with many resource instances.

**Re-computation**: Resources re-run their entire function when tracked dependencies change, which could be less efficient than more granular update patterns.

### Migration and Ecosystem Impact

**Existing Patterns**: The addition of resources doesn't make existing patterns invalid, but it might create inconsistency in codebases during transition periods.

**Addon Ecosystem**: Addons will need time to adopt resource patterns, potentially creating a split between "old" and "new" style addons.

**Testing Infrastructure**: Existing testing patterns and helpers may not work optimally with resources, requiring new testing utilities and patterns.

### TypeScript Complexity

**Advanced Types**: The resource type system, especially around composition with `use()`, involves complex TypeScript patterns that may be difficult for some developers to understand or extend.

**Decorator Limitations**: The `@use` decorator may not provide optimal TypeScript inference in all scenarios due to limitations in decorator typing.

## Alternatives

### Class-Based Resources

Instead of function-based resources, we could provide a class-based API similar to the current ember-resources library:

```js
class TimerResource extends Resource {
  @tracked time = new Date();
  
  setup() {
    this.timer = setInterval(() => {
      this.time = new Date();
    }, 1000);
  }
  
  teardown() {
    clearInterval(this.timer);
  }
}
```

**Pros**: More familiar to developers used to class-based patterns
**Cons**: More verbose, harder to compose, doesn't leverage functional programming benefits

### Built-in Helpers with Lifecycle

Extend the existing helper system to support lifecycle hooks:

```js
export default class TimerHelper extends Helper {
  @tracked time = new Date();
  
  didBecomeActive() {
    this.timer = setInterval(() => {
      this.time = new Date();
    }, 1000);
  }
  
  willDestroy() {
    clearInterval(this.timer);
  }
  
  compute() {
    return this.time;
  }
}
```

**Pros**: Builds on existing helper system
**Cons**: Limited to helper use cases, doesn't solve composition or broader lifecycle management

### Enhanced Modifiers

Expand the modifier system to handle more use cases:

```js
export default class DataModifier extends Modifier {
  modify(element, [url]) {
    // Fetch data and update element
  }
}
```

**Pros**: Builds on existing modifier system
**Cons**: Still limited to DOM-centric use cases, doesn't solve general stateful logic management

### Service-Based Solutions

Encourage using services for all stateful logic:

```js
export default class TimerService extends Service {
  @tracked time = new Date();
  
  startTimer() {
    this.timer = setInterval(() => {
      this.time = new Date();
    }, 1000);
  }
  
  stopTimer() {
    clearInterval(this.timer);
  }
}
```

**Pros**: Uses existing patterns
**Cons**: Too heavyweight for localized state, poor cleanup semantics, singleton limitations

### No Action (Status Quo)

Continue with current patterns and encourage better use of existing primitives.

**Pros**: No additional complexity or learning curve
**Cons**: Doesn't solve the identified problems, perpetuates scattered lifecycle management

## How we teach this

### Terminology and Naming

The term **"resource"** was chosen because:

1. It accurately describes something that requires management (like memory, network connections, timers)
2. It's already familiar to developers from other contexts (system resources, web resources)
3. It emphasizes the lifecycle aspect - resources are acquired and must be cleaned up
4. It unifies existing concepts without deprecating them

**Key terms:**
- **Resource**: A reactive function that manages a stateful process with cleanup
- **Resource Function**: The function passed to `resource()` that defines the behavior
- **Resource Instance**: The instantiated resource tied to a specific owner
- **Resource API**: The object passed to resource functions containing `on`, `use`, and `owner`

### Teaching Strategy

**1. Progressive Enhancement of Existing Patterns**

Introduce resources as a natural evolution of patterns developers already know:

```js
// Familiar pattern - manual lifecycle management
export default class extends Component {
  @tracked time = new Date();
  
  constructor() {
    super(...arguments);
    this.timer = setInterval(() => {
      this.time = new Date();
    }, 1000);
  }
  
  willDestroy() {
    clearInterval(this.timer);
  }
}

// Resource pattern - automatic lifecycle management
const Clock = resource(({ on }) => {
  const time = cell(new Date());
  const timer = setInterval(() => time.set(new Date()), 1000);
  on.cleanup(() => clearInterval(timer));
  return time;
});
```

**2. Emphasize Modern Reactive Principles**

Lead with the foundational principles that make resources powerful:

- **"What can be derived, should be derived"**: Minimize state, maximize derivation
- **Automatic cleanup**: No more manual lifecycle management
- **Glitch-free consistency**: Never observe inconsistent intermediate states
- **Lazy by default**: Expensive operations only run when needed
- **Composable ownership**: Resources clean up their children automatically

**3. Start with Simple Examples, Build to Advanced Patterns**

```js
// Level 1: Basic resource with cleanup
const SimpleTimer = resource(({ on }) => {
  let count = cell(0);
  let timer = setInterval(() => count.set(count.current + 1), 1000);
  on.cleanup(() => clearInterval(timer));
  return count;
});

// Level 2: Async data fetching
const UserData = resource(({ on }) => {
  const state = cell({ loading: true });
  const controller = new AbortController();
  
  fetch('/api/user', { signal: controller.signal })
    .then(r => r.json())
    .then(data => state.set({ loading: false, data }));
    
  on.cleanup(() => controller.abort());
  return state;
});

// Level 3: Resource composition and derivation
const Dashboard = resource(({ use }) => {
  const timer = use(SimpleTimer);
  const userData = use(UserData);
  
  // Derived state - always consistent, no manual synchronization
  return () => ({
    uptime: timer.current,
    user: userData.current,
    // This derivation is glitch-free
    greeting: userData.current.loading 
      ? 'Loading...' 
      : `Welcome back, ${userData.current.data.name}!`
  });
});
```

**4. Address Common Mental Models**

Help developers understand how resources differ from familiar patterns:

| Pattern | Manual Management | Resource Approach |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| Component lifecycle | Split setup/cleanup across hooks | Co-located in single function |
| Data synchronization | Manual effects and state updates | Automatic derivation |
| Error boundaries | Try/catch in multiple places | Centralized error handling |
| Memory management | Manual cleanup tracking | Automatic ownership disposal |
| Testing | Complex component setup | Isolated resource testing |

### Integration with Existing Learning

Resources complement and enhance existing Ember concepts:

- **Components**: Still the primary UI abstraction, now with better tools for managing stateful logic
- **Services**: Still used for app-wide shared state, resources handle localized stateful processes
- **Helpers**: Resources can serve as stateful helpers, while pure functions remain as regular helpers
- **Modifiers**: Resources can encapsulate modifier-like behavior with better composition
- **Tracked Properties**: Resources work with `@tracked`, but `cell` provides more ergonomic patterns

### Advanced Concepts Introduction

Once developers are comfortable with basic resource usage, introduce advanced reactive concepts:

1. **Push-Pull Reactivity**: How resources participate in Ember's reactive system
2. **Lazy vs Scheduled Evaluation**: When and why resources evaluate
3. **Glitch-Free Consistency**: Why derived state is always coherent
4. **Ownership and Disposal**: How automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks
5. **Async Patterns**: Colorless async and avoiding request waterfalls

These concepts position Ember's resource system as a modern, best-in-class reactive architecture while remaining approachable for everyday development.

## Unresolved questions

### Future Synchronization API

While this RFC focuses on the core resource primitive, a future `on.sync` API (similar to what Starbeam provides) could enable even more powerful reactive patterns. However, this is explicitly out of scope for this RFC to keep the initial implementation focused and stable.

### Async Resource Patterns

Should resources support first-class async primitives (like `createAsync` from the dev.to articles) that throw promises for unresolved values? This could enable "colorless async" patterns where async and sync resources compose uniformly, but it would require significant integration with Ember's rendering system.

### Scheduling and Evaluation Strategies

Should resources provide explicit control over evaluation timing (immediate vs lazy vs scheduled)? While the current design uses lazy evaluation by default, certain patterns (like data fetching) might benefit from immediate or scheduled evaluation modes.

### Error Boundaries and Resource Hierarchies

How should errors in parent resources affect child resources? Should there be automatic error boundary mechanisms, or should error handling remain explicit through resource return values?

### Integration with Strict Mode and Template Imports

How should resources work with Ember's strict mode and template imports? Should resources be importable in templates directly, or only through helper invocation?

### Performance Optimization Opportunities

Are there opportunities to optimize resource re-computation through more granular dependency tracking or memoization strategies?

### Testing Utilities

What additional testing utilities should be provided in the box for resource testing? Should there be special test helpers for resource lifecycle management?

### Debugging and Ember Inspector Integration

How should resources appear in Ember Inspector? What debugging information should be available for resource instances and their lifecycles?

### Migration Tooling

Should there be automated codemods to help migrate from existing patterns (class helpers, certain component patterns) to resources?

### Bundle Size Impact

What is the impact on bundle size for applications that don't use resources? Can the implementation be designed to be tree-shakeable?
