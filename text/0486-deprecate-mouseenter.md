# Deprecate support for mouseEnter/Leave/Move Ember events

## Summary

Deprecate support for `mouseenter`, `mouseleave` and `mousemove` events in Ember's EventDispatcher. This affects
the corresponding event handler methods (`mouseEnter() {}`) in Ember components and
`{{action "some" on="mouseenter"}}`.

## Motivation

Ember's EventDispatcher handles "Ember events" by attaching listeners to the app's root element
and relying on the events bubbling up to that element (aka event delegation). There they
are processed and invoke any matching `Ember.Component` event handler method with
the same (camel-cased) method as the event type. Same for element-space `{{action}}`
modifiers.

> Note: for a "Deep Dive on Ember Events" and how they differ from "native events" I refer to
Marie Chatfield's excellent
[blog post](https://medium.com/square-corner-blog/deep-dive-on-ember-events-cf684fd3b808)
or [EmberConf talk](https://youtu.be/G9hXjjHFJVs)

This works fine in general, but `mouseenter`/`mouseleave` events are special as they do
not bubble. In the past it still worked nevertheless as jQuery transparently handled this
for us, as it had special support for event delegation for these events, essentially by using
(bubbling) `mouseover` events to replicate the semantics of `mouseenter`/`mouseleave` events.

When support for jQuery-less apps was introduced, this [left a hole](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16591)
in the jQuery-less EventDispatcher implementation. But as support for those events was and
still is part of Ember's pubic API, we had no chance other than to [implement support
for jQuery-less apps](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/16603) using the same
`mouseover` based approach.

This however comes with a cost: besides an [unresolved issue](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/17228)
the implementation has some performance drawbacks, as it has to process every `mouseover` event on
*any* element, create fake `mouseenter`/`mouseleave` events and try to dispatch them, even when
not a single component/action needs them.

Deprecating support for `mousemove` is also proposed, which is a (bubbling) event that does not have the higher
implementation cost as `mouseenter`/`mouseleave`, but nevertheless requires the EventDispatcher to optimistically handle
these extremely high-volume events.

While efforts to make this more "pay as you go" are [possible](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/17911),
the trade-off of keeping support around still seems unfavorable, as these events fire so
frequently, while they are (most certainly) very rarely used.

This is even more so given that Glimmer Components with their outerHTML semantics do not
work with event handler methods, and `{{action}}` will eventually fade away in favor of
`{{on}}` using native `addListener()`.

## Transition Path

#### Ember.Component

When a component with a `mouseEnter`, `mouseLeave` or `mouseMove` method is created, a deprecation warning will be issued.

The linked migration guide will cover these examples:

Before:

```js
import Component from '@ember/component';

export default class MyComponent extends Component {
  mouseEnter(e) {
    // do something
  }
}
```

After:

```js
import Component from '@ember/component';
import { action } from '@ember/object';

export default class MyComponent extends Component {
  @action
  handleMouseEnter(e) {
    // do something
  }

  didInsertElement() {
    super.didInsertElement(...arguments);
    this.element.addEventListener('mouseenter', this.handleMouseEnter);
  }

  willDestroyElement() {
    super.willDestroyElement(...arguments);
    this.element.removeEventListener('mouseenter', this.handleMouseEnter);
  }
}
```

An alternative to attaching the event listener in the component class is to opt into outer HTML semantics by making the
component tag-less and using the `{{on}}` modifier in the template:

```js
import Component from '@ember/component';
import { action } from '@ember/object';

export default class MyComponent extends Component {
  tagName = '';

  @action
  handleMouseEnter(e) {
    // do something
  }
}
```

```hbs
<div {{on "mouseenter" this.handleMouseEnter}}>
  ...
</div>
```

#### `{{action}}` modifier

Similarily a deprecation warning will be shown when an instance of `{{action}}` is rendered in a template that listens
to one of the deprecated events, and will link to a deprecation guide with the following migration example:

Before:

```hbs
<button {{action "handleMouseEnter" on="mouseEnter"}}>Hover</button>
```

After (based on [RFC471](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0471-on-modifier.md)):

```hbs
<button {{on "mouseenter" this.handleMouseEnter}}>Hover</button>
```

## How We Teach This

The deprecation guide should explain the transition path as shown above.

The references to `mouseenter`, `mouseleave` and `mousemove` should be removed from the Guide's
[Handling Events](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/handling-events/#toc_event-names) section and the API
docs for [Components events](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/classes/Component).

Other than that, no changes are required, as the replacement APIs are all available and
well established, and this RFC does not introduce anything new. Also having certain event
types not be supported by the EventDispatcher is not something new, as other high-volume
events like `mouseover` or `scroll` are also not supported (by default).

## Drawbacks

It requires refactoring existing code that relies on support for these events. But given that
these events are (presumably) rarely used, and the alternatives are easy to implement, this
should not be a major issue.

## Alternatives

We could keep support in place, and eventually work on optimizations that minimize the
performance impact.

## Unresolved questions

None at this point.
